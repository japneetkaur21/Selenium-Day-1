Q3- Difference between implicit & explicit wait along with syntax.

Ans. 1. An implicit wait tells WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available.
The implicit wait is set for the life of the WebDriver object instance.
You can set the implicit wait when you first instantiate the WebDriver.
Syntax :
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

2. Explicit waits are intelligent waits that are confined to a particular web element.
It will be used if we want the execution to wait for some time until some condition achieved.
Syntax :
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(driver.findElement(By.name("submit"))));
